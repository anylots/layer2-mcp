# Layer2 MCP Server ![MCP Implementation](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCP-Implementation-blue)

A model context protocol server for interacting with the Ethereum layer 2 network for development and use, which provides a standardized interface for AI models to interact with blockchain networks, deploy tokens, and manage transactions.

## Overview

The MCP Layer2 server implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) specification, providing AI models with tools to:

1. Basic
- Deploy new ERC20 token contracts
- Transfer ETH to specific addresses
- Transfer ERC20 tokens to specific addresses
- Perform batch transfers to random addresses for testing and simulation
2. Advance
- L1 Settlement & Data Availability Verification
- Support cross-chain

This implementation enables AI assistants to directly interact with blockchain networks through a standardized protocol, making it easier to integrate blockchain capabilities into AI workflows.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how an AI assistant might use these tools:

1. Deploy a new ERC20 token contract:
   ```
   ðŸ‘¤You: Deploy a new ERC20 token

   ðŸ¤–AI: I'll deploy a new ERC20 token contract for you.
   [Tool call: deployToken]
   Result: Token deployed successfully!
           Contract Address: 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
           Transaction Hash: 0xd4ec9bf7ca67a581e78a8637974cd84c9c3524a75efe8851b808f0d58879ebd9
   ```
2. Transfer tokens to an address:
   ```
   ðŸ‘¤You: Transfer 100 erc20 tokens to the address 0x6ea5e8971eC8cf32d43AeB18a6999aFc3a3ec65d

   ðŸ¤–AI: I need to deploy an ERC20 token contract before I can transfer 100 ERC20 tokens to a specified address.
   [Tool call: deployToken]
   Result: Token deployed successfully!
           Contract Address: 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
           Transaction Hash: 0xd4ec9bf7ca67a581e78a8637974cd84c9c3524a75efe8851b808f0d58879ebd9

   ðŸ¤–AI: Now I will use the ERC20 token contract I just deployed to transfer 100 tokens to the address 0x6ea5e8971eC8cf32d43AeB18a6999aFc3a3ec65d.

   [Tool call: transferToken with tokenAddress=0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512, 
               targetAddress=0x6ea5e8971eC8cf32d43AeB18a6999aFc3a3ec65d]
               
   ðŸ¤–AI: ERC20 token transfer has been successfully completed!
   Details:
   Token contract address: 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
   Receiving address: 0x6ea5e8971eC8cf32d43AeB18a6999aFc3a3ec65d
   Transfer transaction hash: 0x82b7bdc69ffebfc946ab5101cf853a06e64d5aceaf96ca4fe70622fcee89d83e
   The token has been successfully transferred to the specified address. Do you need to perform other operations?
   ```

3. Transfer ETH to an address:
   ```
   ðŸ¤–AI: I'll transfer 10 ETH to the specified address.
   [Tool call: transferETH with targetAddress=0x6ea5e8971eC8cf32d43AeB18a6999aFc3a3ec65d, amount=10]
   Result: ETH transfer successful!
           Transaction Hash: 0x9f46076f1c9b84d49c7314d8b8586e20c5c5b389ec56931e510408b3f6052bac
   ```



4. Perform batch transfers:
   ```
   ðŸ¤–AI: I'll execute 100 token transfers over 10 seconds.
   [Tool call: batchTransfer with tokenAddress=0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512, 
               transactionCount=100, durationSeconds=10]
   Result: Batch transfer initiated!
           Processing 100 transactions over 10 seconds.
   ```
